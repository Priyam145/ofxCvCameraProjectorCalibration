# ofxCvCameraProjectorCalibration


* Status : Highly experimental. Don't expect anything to work out of the box, until I have time to do a new pass on the routine! *

**OpenFrameworks addon that helps calibrating a camera and a projector using OpenCV**

Most credits for the actual cv-calibration code goes to
Alvaro Cassinelli & Niklas Bergstr√∂m.
Original :

**Main differences from original :**

* no more dependency to ofxCv2
* cleaned & packed the most relevant classes & functions into an addon
* simplified & extracted the calibration application into an addon example
* implemented some of the original code's suggestions
* implemented an example that shows an interesting usage
